This is a test for attempting to creat a project.

by Jason Hsu


developer log:
Day 1:
- Learned how to run Visual Studio Code
- Review/Learn Python3
- Learned how to use Request
- Learned how to debug Request
- Goal Achieve: Download Costco's website code into my program's textfile!!

Day 2:
- Must log in to see Member Only Item Price
- Redirect to focus on one section first
- Redirect to focus on non-member only items

Day 3:
- Started analyzing specific page with lists of proeucts
- found https://thispointer.com/python-search-strings-in-a-file-and-get-line-numbers-of-lines-containing-the-string/
- This link demosntrates how to put multiple things in an array of recording text
- oepned_file.read() gives you single words per speace, not the entire line!

Day 4:
- solidify excell recording list pattern
    want name(x), link(x), price + date(y) 
- need a initial program that checks if excel page exists?


Day 20:
- Major swap by introducing ItemData class to have a specific type of object for the data storage
- Great idea 1: able to handle product catagories with more than one page of product, which instead of loading page 1, then page 2, then page 3
               the code could automatically handle next page without user posting the link of page 2
- Great idea 2: add spec for products (Q: does all products have specs?) (this is applicable for computers/PC)
- New Goal: GUI
